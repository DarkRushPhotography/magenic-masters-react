This means that the best use case for providedIn: 'platform' is for sharing services over application boundaries. E.g. with Angular Elements.

- test mobile sizes with

```json
  "viewportHeight": 763,
  "viewportWidth": 700,
```

## mainifest

```json
  "related_applications":[
      {
          "platform": "play",
          "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app1",
          "id": "com.example.app1"
      }

IPTC photo metadata
Alternatively, you can embed IPTC photo metadata directly inside an image. You must include the Web Statement of Rights field for your image to be eligible to be shown with the licensable badge. We recommend that you also add the Licensor URL field if you have that information.

Required properties
Web Statement of Rights
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image's use, and optionally other rights information. For example, it could be the terms and conditions that you have on your website. Where applicable, it could also be a Creative Commons License (for example, BY-NC 4.0).

        >

/_
rel="noopener" prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a separate process. Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.
rel="noreferrer" has the same effect, but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page. ⚠️ Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.
