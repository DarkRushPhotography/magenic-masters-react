Art and computers are my two technical passions. In the late 1980's, I began digital art drawing pixelated images on an Apple Macintosh and software development by writing programs on a Commodore 128. Today, as a Lead Software Consultant with a Master's in Computer Information Science from the University of Michigan, I continue to develop these skills. Outside of work, I fulfill my artistic passion by modeling in Blender, developing Extended Reality (XR) applications, and assisting in photography shoots as a FAA Certified Commercial Drone Pilot.
